== Developing with Flexmojos

[[flex-dev-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

This chapter provides an overview of the Flexmojos project for people
interested in using Maven to develop Flex applications and libraries.

[[flex-dev-sect-config-build]]
=== Configuring Build Environment for Flexmojos

Before you attempt to compile Flex libraries and applications with
Maven, you will need to complete two configuration tasks:

* Configure your Maven settings to reference a repository which
   contains the Flex framework

* Add the Flash Player to your PATH to support Flex unit testing

* (Optional) Configure your Maven Settings to include the Sonatype
   plugin group

[[flex-dev-sect-referencing-repo-with-flex]]
==== Referencing a Repository with the Flex Framework

To setup your Maven environment for Flexmojos, you have two options:
you can reference the Sonatype Flexmojos repository directly in a
'pom.xml', or you can install Nexus and add the Sonatype Flexmojos
repository as a proxy repository in your own repository manager. While
the most straightforward option is to reference the repository
directly, downloading and installing Nexus will give you the control
and flexibility you need to cache and manage artifacts generated by
your own build. If you are just interested in getting up and running
with Flexmojos, read <<flex-dev-sect-direct-repo>> next. If you are
interested in a long-term solution which can be deployed to support a
development team, continue to <<flex-dev-sect-proxy-nexus>>.

NOTE: If your organization is already using Sonatype Nexus to proxy
remote repositories, you may already have customized your
'~/.m2/settings.xml' file to point to a single Nexus group. If this is
your situation, you should add a Proxy repository for the Sonatype
Flexmojos repository group at
${flexmojos.repository}[${flexmojos.repository}]. Add this new
repository to the Nexus Repository Group that is referenced by your
development team. Adding a proxy repository for this remote group and
then adding this group to your Nexus installation's public repository
group will give clients of your Nexus instance access to the artifacts
from the Sonatype repository.sonatype.org Nexus instance.

[[flex-dev-sect-direct-repo]]
===== Referencing Sonatype's Flexmojos Repository in a POM

Flexmojos depends on a few artifacts which are not currently available
from the Central Maven repository. These artifacts are available from
a Repository hosted by Sonatype. To use Flexmojos, you will need to
reference this repository from your project's 'pom.xml'. To do this,
add the +repositories+ element shown in <<ex-flex-dev-repository>> to
your project's 'pom.xml'.

[[ex-flex-dev-repository]]
.Adding a Reference to Sonatype's FlexMojos Repository in a POM
----

            <url>${flexmojos.repository}</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>*

</project>
----

The XML shown in <<ex-flex-dev-repository>>, will add this repository
to the list of repositories Maven will consult when it attempts to
download artifacts and plugins.

[[flex-dev-sect-proxy-nexus]]
===== Proxying Sonatype's Flexmojos Repository with Nexus

Instead of pointing directly at the Sonatype Flexmojos repository,
Sonatype recommends that you install a repository manager and proxy
the Sonatype public repository. When you proxy a remote repository
with a repository manager such as Nexus, you gain a level of control
and stability not possible when your build relies directly on external
resources. In addition to this control and stability, a repository
manager also provides you with an deployment target for binary
artifacts generated by your own builds. For instructions on
downloading, installing, and configuring Nexus, refer to the
http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/install.html[Installation
chapter in Repository Management with Nexus].

==== Configure a Flexmojos Proxy Repository in Nexus

Once Nexus is installed and started, complete the following steps to
add a proxy repository for the Sonatype public repository. To add a
new proxy repository:

. Click on the *Repositories* link under *Views/Repositories* in the
  *Nexus* menu on the left-hand side of the Nexus user interface.

. Click on *Repositories* to load the *Repositories* panel.

. In the *Repositories* panel, click on the *Add..* button and select
  Proxy Repository as shown in <<fig-flex-dev-add-proxy-repos>>.

[[fig-flex-dev-add-proxy-repos]]
.Adding a Proxy Repository to Sonatype Nexus
image::figs/web/flex-dev-nexus-add-proxy.png[]

Once you've created a new Proxy repository, you will need to configure
it to point to the Sonatype Flexmojos repository.

. Select the new repository, and then

. Select the Configuration tab in the lower half of the window.

. Populate the following field with the values shown in
  <<fig-flex-dev-sonatype-public-proxy>>.

.. <itemizedlist> Repository ID is "sonatype-flexmojos"

.. Repository Name is "Sonatype Flexmojos Proxy"

.. The Remote Storage Location is
   ${flexmojos.repository}[${flexmojos.repository}]

[[fig-flex-dev-sonatype-public-proxy]]
.Configuring the Sonatype Flexmojos Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/flex-dev-nexus-sonatype-proxy.png[]

Once you have populated the fields shown in
<<fig-flex-dev-sonatype-public-proxy>> click the *Save* button to save
the proxy repository and start proxying the Sonatype Flexmojos
repository.

===== Add the Flexmojos Proxy Repository to a Group

Nexus ships with a public repository group, which combines several
repositories into a single URL for Maven clients. Add this new
Flexmojos proxy repository to the Nexus public group. To do this:

. Return to the list of repositories which should now be visible in
  the upper half of the Repositories panel as shown in
  <<fig-flex-dev-sonatype-public-proxy>>.

. Click on the Public Repositories group, and then

. Click on the Configuration tab in the lower half of the Repository
  panel. Clicking the Configuration tab will expose the Group
  configuration form shown in
  <<fig-flex-dev-adding-sonatype-to-group>>.

[[fig-flex-dev-adding-sonatype-to-group]]
.Adding the Sonatype Flexmojos Proxy to the Public Repositories Group
image::figs/web/flex-dev-nexus-sonatype-to-group.png[]

. To add the *Sonatype Public Proxy* to the *Public Repositories*
  group simply drag and drop the *Sonatype Public Proxy* repository
  from the *Available Repositories* list to the *Ordered Group
  Repositories* list.

. Click *Save*, and you have successfully added a proxy of the
  Sonatype Flexmojos repository to your Nexus installation.

Whenever a client requests an artifact from this repository group, if
Nexus has not already cached a matching artifact, it will query the
Sonatype Flexmojos repository at
${flexmojos.repository}[${flexmojos.repository}]. Your Nexus
installation will maintain a local cache of all artifacts retrieved
from the Sonatype Flexmojos repository. This local cache gives you
more control and contributes to a more stable build environment. If
you are setting up a group of developers to rely upon artifacts from
the Sonatype public repository, you'll have a completely
self-contained build environment that won't be subject to the
availability of the Sonatype repository once the necessary artifacts
have been cached by your Nexus instance.

===== Configure Your Development Environment for Nexus

The final step is connecting your Maven installation to the Nexus
instance you just configured. You will need to update your Maven
Settings to use your Nexus repository group as a mirror for all
repositories. To do this, you need to put the following XML in your
'~/.m2/settings.xml' file.

[[ex-flex-dev-settings-local-nexus]]
.Settings XML for Local Nexus Instance
----
<settings>
    <mirrors>
        <mirror>

                    <url>http://central</url>
                    <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
                    <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
                </repository>
            </repositories>
            <pluginRepositories>
                <pluginRepository>
                    <id>central</id>
                    <url>http://central</url>
                    <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
                    <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
                </pluginRepository>
            </pluginRepositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>nexus</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
</settings>
----

This XML file configures Maven to consult a single public repository
group for all configured repositories and plugin repositories. It is a
simple way to guarantee that every request for an artifact is made
through your Nexus installation.

[[flex-dev-sect-configuring-unit-tests]]
==== Configuring Environment to Support Flex Unit Tests

Flexmojos expects to be able to launch the stand-alone Flash Player to
execute unit tests. In order for this to work, you will need to add
the stand-alone Flash Player to your PATH, or you will need to pass
the location of the Flash Player executable to your build using the
+-DflashPlayer.command+ options. When executing a unit test, Flex
Mojos expects to launch the following platform-specific executables
for the stand-alone Flash Player:

Microsoft Windows::

   FlexMojos will attempt to launch the 'FlashPlayer.exe' binary. To
   support execution of unit tests, add the directory containing
   'FlashPlayer.exe' to your PATH or pass in the location of the
   'FlashPlayer.exe' binary to Maven using the
   +-DflashPlayer.command=${filepath}+ command-line option.

Macintosh OSX::

   FlexMojos will attempt to launch the "Flash Player" application. To
   support the execution of unit tests, add the directory containing
   "Flash Player" to your PATH or pass the path to the executable to
   Maven using the +-DflashPlayer.command=${filepath}+ command-line
   option.

Unix (Linux, Solaris, etc.)::

   FlexMojos will attempt to launch the 'flashplayer' executable. To
   support the execution of unit tests, add the directory containing
   'flashplayer' to your PATH or pass the path to the executable to
   Maven using the +-DflashPlayer.command=${filepath}+ command-line
   option.

NOTE: On a Linux machine, you will need to have X virtual framebuffer
(Xvfb) installed to run unit tests in a headless build. For more
information about Xvfb, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb[click here].

If you have been developing Flash Applications with Adobe Flash CS4 or
Adobe Flex Builder or if you have been viewing flash content in a
browser, you probably have the Flash Player installed somewhere on
your workstation. While it is possible to configure Maven to use one
of these players for Flex unit tests, you'll want to make sure that
you are running the debug version of the Flash Player. To minimize the
potential for incompatibility, you should download one of the Flash
Player's listed below and install it on your local workstation. To
download the standalone Flash Player for you environment:

* Windows:
   http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flashplayer_10_sa_debug.exe[http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flashplayer_10_sa_debug.exe]

* Mac OSX:
   http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flashplayer_10_sa_debug.app.zip[http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flashplayer_10_sa_debug.app.zip]

* Linux:
   http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flash_player_10_linux_dev.tar.gz[http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/flash_player_10_linux_dev.tar.gz]

To install this player and add it to your PATH on an OSX machine, run
the following commands:

----
$ wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/10/\
       flashplayer_10_sa_debug.app.zip
$ unzip flashplayer_10_sa_debug.app.zip
$ sudo cp -r Flash\ Player.app /Applications/
$ export PATH=/Applications/Flash\ Player.app/Contents/MacOS:${PATH}
----

Instead of adding the path for the Flash Player to your PATH on the
command-line, you should configure your environment to automatically
configure these variables. If you are using bash, you would add the
last export command to your '~/.bash_profile'.

[[flex-dev-sect-plugin-group]]
==== Adding FlexMojos to Your Maven Settings' Plugin Groups

If you need to run FlexMojos goals from the command-line, it will be
more convenient if you add the Sonatype Plugin groups to your Maven
Settings. To do this, open up '~/.m2/settings.xml' and add the
following plugin groups:

.Adding Sonatype Plugins to Maven Settings
----
<pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>com.sonatype.maven.plugins</pluginGroup>
    <pluginGroup>org.sonatype.plugins</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>
----

Once you've added these plugin groups to your Maven Settings you can
invoke a FlexMojos goal using the plugin prefix +flexmojos+. Without
this configuration, calling the +flexbuilder+ goal would involve the
following command-line:

----
$ mvn org.sonatype.flexmojos:flexmojos-maven-plugin:${flexmojos.version}:flexbuilder
----

With the org.sonatype.plugins group in your Maven settings, the same
goal can be invoked with:

----
$ mvn flexmojos:flexbuilder
----

[[flex-dev-sect-creating-with-archetype]]
=== Creating a Flex Mojos Project from an Archetype

Flexmojos has a set of archetypes which can be used to quickly create
a new Flex project. The following archetypes are all in the
+org.sonatype.flexmojos+ group with a version of
+${flexmojos.version}+:

flexmojos-archetypes-library::

  Creates a simple Flex Library project which produces a SWC

flexmojos-archetypes-application::

  Creates a simple Flex Application with produces a SWF

flexmojos-archetypes-modular-webapp::

  Creates a Multimodule project which consists of a project that
  produces a SWC which is consumed by a project which produces a SWF
  that is ultimately presented in a project that generates a WAR

[[flex-dev-sect-library-archetype]]
==== Creating a Flex Library

<<fig-flex-dev-simple-lib-pom>> is very simple, the key to this POM is
the +flexmojos-maven-plugin+ configuration which sets +extensions+ to
+true+. This configuration customizes the lifecycle for the +swc+
packaging which is defined in the +flexmojos-maven-plugin+. The
archetype then includes the +flex-framework+ dependency and the
+flexmojos-unittest-support+ test-scoped dependency. The
+flex-framework+ dependency is a POM which contains references to the
SWC libraries and resources required to compile Flex applications.

In <<fig-flex-dev-simple-lib-pom>>, the packaging is very critical. A
POMs packaging type controls the lifecycle it uses to produce build
output. The value +swc+ in the packaging element is Maven's cue to
look for the Flex-specific lifecycle customizations which are provided
by the +flexmojos-maven-plugin+. The other important part of this POM
is the build element which specifies the location of the Flex source
code and the Flex unit tests. Next, let's take a quick look at
<<ex-flex-dev-lib-as>> which contains the sample Actionscript which
was created by this archetype.

[[ex-flex-dev-lib-as]]
.Flex Library Archetype's Sample App Class
----
package org.sonatype.test {
  public class App {
    public static function greeting(name:String):String {
      return "Hello, " + name;
    }
  }
}
----

While this code is underwhelming, it does provide you with a quick
model and a quick pointer: "Place More Code Here". While it might seem
silly to test code this simple, a sample test named 'TestApp.as' is
provides in the 'src/test/flex' directory. This test is shown in
<<ex-flex-dev-test-app>>.

[[ex-flex-dev-test-app]]
.Unit Test for Library Archetype's App Class
----
package org.sonatype.test {

    import flexunit.framework.TestCase;

    public class TestApp extends TestCase {

        /**
         * Tests our greeting() method
         */
        public function testGreeting():void {
            var name:String = "Buck Rogers";
            var expectedGreeting:String = "Hello, Buck Rogers";

            var result:String = App.greeting(name);
            assertEquals("Greeting is incorrect", expectedGreeting, result);
        }
    }
}
----

To run this build, go to the sample-library project directory and run
mvn install.

NOTE: To execute Flex unit tests you will need to configure your PATH
environment variable to include the Flash Player. For more information
about configuring FlexMojos for unit tests, see
<<flex-dev-sect-configuring-unit-tests>>.

When you ran +mvn install+ on this project, you should notice in the
output that Maven and Flexmojos plugin is take care of managing all of
the libraries and the dependencies for the Flex compiler. Much like
Maven excels at helping Java developers manage the contents of a Java
classpath, Maven can help Flex developers manage the complex of
compile paths. You also might have been shocked when the Flexmojos
project started a web browser or the Flash Player and used it to
execute the TestApp.as class against the project's source code.

The difference between <<ex-flex-dev-app-pom>> and
<<fig-flex-dev-simple-lib-pom>> is that the +packaging+ element is
+swf+ instead of +swc+. By setting the packaging to +swf+, the project
will produce a Flex application in
'target/sample-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swf'. The sample application
created by this archetype displays the Text "Hello World". 'Main.mxml'
can be found in 'src/main/flex'.

.Sample Application Main.mxml
----
<mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" layout="absolute">
    <mx:Text text="Hello World!"/>
</mx:Application>
----

This application also creates a simple FlexUnit test that does nothing
more than print out a trace message. The sample unit test is in
'src/test/flex/org/sonatype/test'.

.Unit Test for Main.mxml
----
package org.sonatype.test 
{

    import flexunit.framework.TestCase;
    import Main;

    public class TestApp extends TestCase 
    {

        public function testNothing():void 
        {
            //TODO un implemented
            trace("Hello test"); 
        }
    }

When you declare a dependency on a SWC, you'll need to specify the
type of the dependency so that Maven can locate the appropriate
artifact in the remote or local repository. In this case, the
+swf-swf+ project depends upon the SWC that is generated by the
+swc-swc+ project. When you add the dependency to the +swf-swf+
project, the FlexMojos plugin will add the appropriate SWC file to the
Flex Compiler's library path.

Next, take a look at the simple POM in the war module.

The POM shown in <<ex-flex-war-module-pom>> configures the FlexMojos
plugin to execute the +copy-flex-resources+ goal for this project. The
+copy-flex-resources+ goal will copy SWF application into the web
application's document root. In this project, running a build and
creating a WAR will copy the 'swf-swf-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swf' file to the
web application's root directory in 'target/war-war-1.0-SNAPSHOT'.

To build the multimodule web application project, run +mvn install+
from the top-level directory. This should build the +swc-swc+,
+swf-swf+, and +war-war+ artifacts and product a WAR file in
war'/target/war-war-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war' which contains the
'swf-swf-1.0-SNAPSHOT.swf' in the document root of the web
application.

NOTE: To execute Flex unit tests you will need to configure your PATH
environment variable to include the Flash Player. For more information
about configuring FlexMojos for unit tests, see
<<flex-dev-sect-configuring-unit-tests>>.

[[flex-dev-sect-custom-lifecycle]]
=== The FlexMojos Lifecycle

The FlexMojos Maven plugin customizes the lifecycle based on the
packaging. If your project has a +packaging+ of type +swc+ or +swf,+
the FlexMojos plugin with execute a customized lifecycle if your
plugin configuration sets the extensions to
true. <<ex-flex-dev-extensions-true>> shows the plugin configuration
for the flexmojos-maven-plugin with the +extensions+ set to +true+.

==== The SWC Lifecycle

When the packaging is swc, FlexMojos will execute the lifecycle shown
in <<fig-flex-dev-swc-lifecycle>>. The highlighted goals are goals
from the FlexMojos plugin, the goals which are not highlights are
standard goals from the Core Maven plugins.

[[fig-flex-dev-swc-lifecycle]]
.The FlexMojos SWC Lifecycle
image::figs/web/flex-dev_swc-lifecycle.png[]

The FlexMojos contributed goals are:

flexmojos:compile-swc::

   This goal compiles all of the Actionscript and MXML files in the
   +sourceDirectory+ into a SWC. A SWC is an Adobe library or class
   file which contains components and resources used in Flex
   applications.

flexmojos:test-compile::

   This goal compiles all of the Actionscript and MXML files in the
   +testSourceDirectory+.

flexmojos:test-run::

   This goal executes unit tests using the Flash Player. This goal can
   only run if the Flash Player has been configured as described in
   <<flex-dev-sect-configuring-unit-tests>>.

[[flex-dev-sect-lifecycle-swf]]
==== The SWF Lifecycle

When the packaging is swf, FlexMojos will execute the lifecycle shown
in <<fig-flex-dev-swf-lifecycle>>. The highlighted goals are goals
from the FlexMojos plugin, the goals which are not highlights are
standard goals from the Core Maven plugins.

[[fig-flex-dev-swf-lifecycle]]
.The FlexMojos SWF Lifecycle
image::figs/web/flex-dev_swf-lifecycle.png[]

The FlexMojos contributed goals are:

flexmojos:compile-swf::

   This goal compiles all of the Actionscript and MXML files in the
   +sourceDirectory+ into a SWF. A SWF is a file which contains an
   application that can be render by the Adobe Flash Player or Adobe
   AIR software.

flexmojos:test-compile::

   This goal compiles all of the Actionscript and MXML files in the
   +testSourceDirectory+.

flexmojos:test-run::

   This goal executes unit tests using the Flash Player. This goal can
   only run if the Flash Player has been configured as described in
   <<flex-dev-sect-configuring-unit-tests>>.

[[flex-dev-sect-goals]]

  Run the tests using the Adobe Flash Player

flexmojos:test-swc::

  Build a SWC containing the test classes for a specific project

flexmojos:wrapper::

  Generate an HTML wrapper for a SWF application

[[flex-dev-sect-gen-asdoc]]
==== Generating Actionscript Documentation

You can run the asdoc or asdoc-report goals to generate documentation
for Actionscript. Once the goals has completed, the documentation will
be saved to '+++${basedir}/target/asdoc+++' as
HTML. <<fig-flex-dev-actionscript>> shows the result of running the
+asdoc+ goal against the Flexmojos application archetype project.

[[fig-flex-dev-actionscript]]
.Actionscript Documentation Generated by the FlexMojos Plugin
image::figs/web/flex-dev_asdoc-browser.png[]

[[flex-dev-sect-compiling]]
==== Compiling Flex Source

FlexMojos contains a number of goals which compile Actionscript and
MXML into SWCs and SWFs. The compile-swc and compile-swf goals are
used to generate output from a project's source, and test-compile is
used to compile unit tests. In the simple projects created by the
FlexMojos archetypes, the compile-swc and compile-swf goals are called
because the project customizes the lifecycle and binds either
compile-swc or compile-swf to the compile phase and test-compile to
the test-compile phase. If you need to configure the options for the
FlexMojos compiler, you would configure the FlexMojos plugin
configuration. For example, if you wanted the application with the POM
shown in <<ex-flex-dev-app-pom>> to ignore certain code-level warnings
on compile and use some customized font settings, you might use the
plugin configuration shown in <<ex-flex-dev-customizing-compiler>>.

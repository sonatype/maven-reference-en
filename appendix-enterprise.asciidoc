== Appendix: Sun Specification Alternatives

The Apache Geronimo project maintains implementations of various
enterprise Java specifications. <<table-spec-alternatives>> lists the
artifactId and artifact version for all of the specifications
implemented by the Geronimo project. To use one of these dependencies,
use a groupId of +org.apache.geronimo.specs+, locate the version of
the Specification you want to use and reference the dependency with
the Artifact Id and Artifact Version listed in
<<table-spec-alternatives>>.

NOTE: All artifacts in <<table-spec-alternatives>>, have a groupId of
+org.apache.geronimo.specs+.

NOTE: The version numbers in the Artifact Version column may be out of
date by the time you read this book. To check on the version number,
visit
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/geronimo/specs/[http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/geronimo/specs/]
in a web browser, and click on the artifactId you want to add. Choose
the highest version of the spec you want to depend upon.

To illustrate how one would use <<table-spec-alternatives>>, if we
wanted to write some code in our project which interacted with the JTA
1.0.1B specification, we would need to add the following dependency to
our project:

.Adding JTA 1.0.1B to a Maven Project
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.geronimo.specs</groupId>
    <artifactId>geronimo-jta_1.0.1B_spec</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

Notice how the version of the artifact isn't going to line up with the
version of the specificationâ€”the previous dependency configuration
adds version 1.0.1B of the JTA specification using the artifact
version of 1.1.1. Be aware of this when depending on the alternate
Geronimo implementations, and always double check that you are using
the latest artifact version number for your specifications.

== Running Maven

This chapter focuses on the various ways in which Maven can be
customized at runtime. It also provides some documentation of special
features such as the ability to customize the behavior of the Maven
Reactor and how to use the Maven Help plugin to obtain information
about plugins and plugin goals.

[[running-sect-options]]
=== Maven Command Line Options

The following sections detail Maven's command line options.

[[running-sect-define-prop]]
==== Defining Properties

To define a property use the following option on the command line:

-D, --define <arg>::

  Defines a system property

This is the option most frequently used to customized the behavior of
Maven plugins. Some examples of using the +-D+ command line argument:

----
$ mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compiler:compile
$ mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
----

Properties defined on the command line are also available as
properties to be used in a Maven POM or Maven Plugin. Form more
information about referencing Maven properties, see
<<resource-filtering>>.

Properties can also be used to activate build profiles. For more
information about Maven build profiles, see <<profiles>>.

[[running-sect-help-option]]
==== Getting Help

To list the available command line parameters, use the following
command line option:

-h, --help::

  Display help information

Executing Maven with this option produces the following output:

----
$ mvn --help

usage: mvn [options] [<goal(s)>] [<phase(s)>]

Options:
-am,--also-makeIf project list is specified, also
build projects required by the
list
-amd,--also-make-dependentsIf project list is specified, also
build projects that depend on
projects on the list
-B,--batch-modeRun in non-interactive (batch)
mode
...
----

If you are looking for information about the goals and parameters
available from a specific Maven plugin, see
<<installation-sect-help-plugin-install>>.

[[running-sect-profile-option]]
==== Using Build Profiles

To activate one or more build profiles from the command line, use the
following option:

-P, --activate-profiles <arg>::

  Comma-delimited list of profiles to activate

For more information about build profiles, see <<profiles>>.

[[running-sect-version-option]]
==== Displaying Version Information

To display Maven version information, use one of the following options
on the command line:

-V, --show-version::

  Display version information WITHOUT stopping build

-v, --version::

  Display version information

Both of these options produce the same version information output, but
the -v option will terminate the Maven process after printing out the
version. You would use the -V option if you wanted to have the Maven
version information present at the beginning of your build's
output. This can come in handy if you are running Maven in a
continuous build environment and you need to know what version of
Maven was used for a particular build.

.Maven Version Information
----
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r801777; 2009-08-06 14:16:01-0500)
Java version: 1.6.0_15
Java home: /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: MacRoman
OS name: "mac os x" version: "10.6.1" arch: "x86_64" Family: "mac"
----

[[running-sect-offline-option]]
==== Running in Offline Mode

If you ever need to use Maven without having access to a network, you
should use the following option to prevent any attempt to check for
updates to plugins or dependencies over a network:

-o, --offline::

  Work offline

When running with the offline option enabled, Maven will not attempt
to connect to a remote repository to retrieve artifacts.

[[running-sect-custom-locations-option]]
==== Using a Custom POM or Custom Settings File

If you don't like the 'pom.xml' file name, the location of your
user-specific Maven settings, or the default location of your global
settings file, you can customize any of these things with the
following options:

-f, --file <file>::

  Forces the use of an alternate POM file

-s,--settings <arg>::

  Alternate path for the user settings file

-gs, --global-settings <file>::

  Alternate path for the global settings file

[[running-sect-encrypt-option]]
==== Encrypting Passwords

The following commands allow you to use Maven to encrypt passwords for
storage in a Maven settings file:

-emp, --encrypt-master-password <password>::

   Encrypt master security password

-ep, --encrypt-password <password>::

   Encrypt server password

Encrypting passwords is documented in
<<appendix-settings-sect-encrypting-passwords>>.

[[running-sect-failure-option]]
==== Dealing with Failure

The following options control how Maven reacts to a build failure in
the middle of a multi-module project build:

-fae, --fail-at-end::

  Only fail the build afterwards; allow all non-impacted builds to continue

-ff, --fail-fast::

  Stop at first failure in reactorized builds

-fn, --fail-never::

  NEVER fail the build, regardless of project result

The +-fn+ and +-fae+ options are useful options for multi-module
builds that are running within a continuous integration tool like
Hudson. The +-ff+ option is very useful for developers running
interactive builds who want to have rapid feedback during the
development cycle.

[[running-sect-verbose-option]]
==== Controlling Maven's Verbosity

If you want to control Maven's logging level, you can use one of the
following three command line options:

-e, --errors::

  Produce execution error messages

-X, --debug::

  Produce execution debug output

-q, --quiet::

  Quiet output - only show errors

The +-q+ option only prints a message to the output if there is an
error or a problem.

The +-X+ option will print an overwhelming amount of debugging log
messages to the output. This option is primarily used by Maven
developers and by Maven plugin developers to diagnose problems with
Maven code during development. This +-X+ option is also very useful if
you are attempting to diagnose a difficult problem with a dependency
or a classpath.

The +-e+ option will come in handy if you are a Maven developer, or if
you need to diagnose an error in a Maven plugin. If you are reporting
an unexpected problem with Maven or a Maven plugin, you will want to
pass both the +-X+ and +-e+ options to your Maven process.

[[running-sect-batch-option]]
==== Running Maven in Batch Mode

To run Maven in batch mode use the following option:

-B, --batch-mode::

  Run in non-interactive (batch) mode

Batch mode is essential if you need to run Maven in a non-interactive,
continuous integration environment. When running in non-interactive
mode, Maven will never stop to accept input from the user. Instead, it
will use sensible default values when it requires input.

[[running-sect-deps-option]]
==== Downloading and Verifying Dependencies

The following command line options affect the way that Maven will
interact with remote repositories and how it verifies downloaded
artifacts:

-C, --strict-checksums::

  Fail the build if checksums don't match

-c, --lax-checksums::

  Warn if checksums don't match

-U, --update-snapshots::

  Forces a check for updated releases and snapshots on remote repositories

If you are concerned about security, you will want to run Maven with
the +-C+ option. Maven repositories maintain an MD5 and SHA1 checksum
for every artifact stored in a repository. Maven is configured to warn
the end-user if an artifact's checksum doesn't match the downloaded
artifact. Passing in the +-C+ option will cause Maven to fail the
build if it encounters an artifact with a bad checksum.

The +-U+ option is useful if you want to make sure that Maven is
checking for the latest versions of all SNAPSHOT dependencies.

[[running-sect-norecurse-option]]
==== Non-recursive Builds

There will be times when you simply want to run a Maven build without
having Maven descend into all of a project's submodules. You can do
this by using the following command line option:

-N, --non-recursive::

   Prevents Maven from building submodules. Only builds the project
   contained in the current directory.

Running this will only cause Maven to execute a goal or step through
the lifecycle for the project in the current directory. Maven will not
attempt to build all of the projects in a multi-module project when
you use the +-N+ command line option.

=== Using Advanced Reactor Options

Starting with the Maven 2.1 release, there are new Maven command line
options which allow you to manipulate the way that Maven will build
multimodule projects. These new options are:

-rf, --resume-from::

  Resume reactor from specified project


-pl, --projects::

  Build specified reactor projects instead of all projects


-am, --also-make::

  If project list is specified, also build projects required by the
  list


-amd, --also-make-dependents::

  If project list is specified, also build projects that depend on
  projects on the list

[[running-sect-downloading-aro]]
==== Advanced Reactor Options Example Project

The example in this section is a skeleton of a complex multimodule
project that is used to illustrate the advanced reactor options. While
it is possible to read this section without the example code, you
might want to download the example code and follow along,
experimenting with the various options as you learn how to use the
advanced reactor options. This section’s example project may be
downloaded with the book’s example code at:

----
http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/mvnref-examples.zip
----

Unzip this archive in any directory, and then go to the 'ch-running/'
directory. There you will see a directory named 'sample-parent/'.  All
of the examples in this section will be executed from the
'examples/ch-running/sample-parent/' directory in the examples
distribution. The sample-parent/ directory contains the multimodule
project structure shown in <<fig-running-aro-dir-struct>>.

[[fig-running-aro-dir-struct]]
.Directory Structure of Sample Multi-module Project
image::figs/web/running_aro-project-dir.png[]

This project approximates the structure of a real-world enterprise
project: the +sample-model+ project contains a set of foundational
model objects used throughout the system, the +sample-util+ project
would contain utility code, the +sample-persist+ project would contain
logic that deals with persisting objects to a database, and the other
projects would all be combined to produce the various GUI and
Web-based interfaces that comprise a very complex
system. <<fig-running-aro-depends>> captures the dependencies between
each of these sample modules.

[[fig-running-aro-depends]]
.Dependencies within Sample Multi-module Project
image::figs/web/running_aro-dependencies.png[]

If you go into the 'sample-parent/' project directory and run +mvn
clean+, you will see that the Maven Reactor reads all of the project
dependencies and comes up with the following build order for these
projects as shown in <<ex-running-aro-order>>.

[[ex-running-aro-order]]
.Order of Project Builds in Maven Reactor
----
[INFO] Reactor build order: 
[INFO]   sample-parent
[INFO]   sample-model
[INFO]   sample-persist
[INFO]   sample-services
[INFO]   sample-util
[INFO]   sample-security
[INFO]   sample-admin-webapp
[INFO]   sample-webapp
[INFO]   sample-rest
[INFO]   sample-client-connector
[INFO]   sample-gui
[INFO]   sample-admin-gui
----

==== Resuming Builds

The +-rf+ or +--resume-from+ option can come in handy if you want to
tell the Maven Reactor to resume a build from a particular
project. This can be useful if you are working with a large
multimodule project and you want to restart a build at a particular
project in the Reactor without running through all of the projects
that precede it in the build order.

Assume that you are working on the multi-module project with the build
order shown in <<ex-running-aro-order>> and that your build ran
successfully up until Maven encountered a failing unit test in
+sample-client-connector+. With the +-rf+ option, you can fix the unit
test in +simple-client-connector+ and then run +mvn -rf
sample-client-connect+ from the 'sample-parent/' directory to resume
the build with the final three projects.

----
$ mvn --resume-from sample-client-connector install
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Reactor build order: 
[INFO]   sample-client-connector
[INFO]   sample-gui
[INFO]   sample-admin-gui
...
----

==== Specifying a Subset of Projects

The +-pl+ or +--projects+ option allows you to select a list of
projects from a multimodule project. This option can be useful if you
are working on a specific set of projects, and you'd rather not wait
for a full build of a multi-module project during a development cycle.

Assume that you are working on the multi-module project with the build
order shown in <<ex-running-aro-order>> and that you are a developer
focused on the +sample-rest+ and +sample-client-connector+
projects. If you only wanted Maven to build the +sample-rest+ and
+sample-client-connector+ project, you would use the following syntax
from the 'sample-parent/' directory:

----
$ mvn --projects sample-client-connector,sample-rest install
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Reactor build order: 
[INFO]   sample-rest
[INFO]   sample-client-connector
----

[[running-sect-make-subset]]
==== Making a Subset of Projects

If you wanted to run a portion of the larger build, you would use the
+-pl+ or +--projects+ option with the +-am+ or +--also-make+
option. When you specify a project with the +-am+ option, Maven will
build all of the projects that the specified project depends upon
(either directly or indirectly). Maven will examine the list of
projects and walk down the dependency tree, finding all of the
projects that it needs to build.

If you are working on the multi-module project with the build order
shown in <<ex-running-aro-order>> and you were only interested in
working on the +sample-services+ project, you would run +mvn -pl
simple-services -am+ to build only those projects

----
$ mvn --projects sample-services --also-make install
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Reactor build order: 
[INFO]   sample-parent
[INFO]   sample-model
[INFO]   sample-persist
[INFO]   sample-services
----

==== Making Project Dependents

While the +-am+ command makes all of the projects required by a
particular project in a multi-module build, the +-amd+ or
+--also-make-dependents+ option configures Maven to build a project
and any project that depends on that project. When using
+--also-make-dependents+, Maven will examine all of the projects in
our reactor to find projects that depend on a particular project. It
will automatically build those projects and nothing else.

If you are working on the multi-module project with the build order
shown in <<ex-running-aro-order>> and you wanted to make sure that
your changes to +sample-services+ did not introduce any errors into
the projects that directly or indirectly depend on +sample-services+,
you would run the following command:

----
$ mvn --projects sample-services --also-make-dependents install
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Reactor build order: 
[INFO]   sample-services
[INFO]   sample-admin-webapp
[INFO]   sample-webapp
[INFO]   sample-rest
----

[[running-sect-resuming]]
==== Resuming a "make" build

When using +--also-make+, Maven will execute a subset of the larger
build as shown in <<running-sect-make-subset>>. Combining +--project+,
+--also-make+, and +--resume-from+ provides you with the ability to
refine your build even further. The +-rf+ or +--resume-from+ resumes
the build from a specific point in the Reactor build order.

----
$ mvn --projects sample-webapp --also-make \
      --resume-from sample-services install
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Reactor build order: 
[INFO]   sample-services
[INFO]   sample-util
[INFO]   sample-security
[INFO]   sample-webapp
----

In this example, the build is resumed from +sample-services+ which
omits the +sample-persist+ and +sample-model+ projects from the
build. If you are focused on individual components and you need to
accelerate your build times, using these advanced reactor options
together is a great way to skip portions of your large multi-module
project build. The +--resume-from+ argument also works with
+--also-make-dependents+.

[[installation-sect-help-plugin-install]]
=== Using the Maven Help Plugin

Throughout this book, we introduce Maven plugins, talking about Maven
Project Object Model (POM) files, settings files, and profiles. There
are going to be times when you need a tool to help you make sense of
some of the models that Maven is using and what goals are available on
a specific plugin. The Maven Help plugin allows you to list active
Maven profiles, display an effective POM, print the effective
settings, or list the attributes of a Maven plugin.

The Maven Help plugin has four goals. The first three
goals — +active-profiles+, +effective-pom+, and
+effective-settings+ — describe a particular project and must be run in
the base directory of a project. The last goal — +describe+ — is slightly
more complex, showing you information about a plugin or a plugin
goal. The following commands provide some general information about
the four goals:

help:active-profiles::

   Lists the profiles (project, user, global) which are active for the
   build.

help:effective-pom::

   Displays the effective POM for the current build, with the active
   profiles factored in.

help:effective-settings::

   Prints out the calculated settings for the project, given any
   profile enhancement and the inheritance of the global settings into
   the user-level settings.

help:describe::

   Describes the attributes of a plugin. This need not run under an
   existing project directory. You must at least give the +groupId+
   and +artifactId+ of the plugin you wish to describe.

[[installation-sect-describing-plugin]]
==== Describing a Maven Plugin

Once you start using Maven, you'll spend most of your time trying to
get more information about Maven Plugins: How do plugins work? What
are the configuration parameters? What are the goals? The
+help:describe+ goal is something you'll be using very frequently to
retrieve this information. With the +plugin+ parameter you can specify
a plugin you wish to investigate, passing in either the plugin prefix
(e.g. +maven-help-plugin+ as +help+) or the
+groupId:artifact[:version]+, where version is optional. For example,
the following command uses the Help plugin's +describe+ goal to print
out information about the Maven Help plugin.

----
$ mvn help:describe -Dplugin=help
...
Group Id:  org.apache.maven.plugins
Artifact Id: maven-help-plugin
Version: 2.0.1
Goal Prefix: help
Description:

The Maven Help plugin provides goals aimed at helping to make sense
out of the build environment. It includes the ability to view the
effective POM and settings files, after inheritance and active
profiles have been applied, as well as a describe a particular plugin
goal to give usage information.  ...

----

Executing the +describe+ goal with the +plugin+ parameter printed out
the Maven coordinates for the plugin, the goal prefix, and a brief
description of the plugin. While this information is helpful, you'll
usually be looking for more detail than this. If you want the Help
plugin to print a full list of goals with parameters, execute the
+help:describe+ goal with the parameter +full+ as follows:

----
$ mvn help:describe -Dplugin=help -Dfull
...
Group Id:  org.apache.maven.plugins
Artifact Id: maven-help-plugin
Version: 2.0.1
Goal Prefix: help
Description:

The Maven Help plugin provides goals aimed at helping to make sense
out of the build environment. It includes the ability to view the
effective POM and settings files, after inheritance and active
profiles have been applied, as well as a describe a particular plugin
goal to give usage information.

Mojos:

Goal: 'active-profiles'
Description:

Lists the profiles which are currently active for this build.

Implementation: org.apache.maven.plugins.help.ActiveProfilesMojo
Language: java

Parameters:

[0] Name: output
Type: java.io.File
Required: false
Directly editable: true
Description:

This is an optional parameter for a file destination for the output of
this mojo...the listing of active profiles per project.


[1] Name: projects
Type: java.util.List
Required: true
Directly editable: false
Description:

This is the list of projects currently slated to be built by Maven.


This mojo doesn't have any component requirements.

... removed the other goals ...

----

This option is great for discovering all of a plugin's goals as well
as their parameters. But sometimes this is far more information than
necessary. To get information about a single goal, set the +mojo+
parameter as well as the +plugin+ parameter. The following command
lists all of the information about the Compiler plugin's +compile+
goal.

----
$ mvn help:describe -Dplugin=compiler -Dmojo=compile -Dfull
----

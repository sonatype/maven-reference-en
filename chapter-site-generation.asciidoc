== Site Generation

[[site-generation-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Successful software applications are rarely produced by a team of
one. When we're talking about any software worth writing, we're
usually dealing with teams of collaborating developers ranging
anywhere in size from a handful of programmers working in a small team
to hundreds or thousands of programmers working in a large distributed
environment. Most open source projects (such as Maven) succeed or fail
based on the presence or absence of well written documentation for a
widely-distributed, ad-hoc collection of users and developers. In all
environments it is important for projects to have an easy way to
publish and maintain online documentation. Software development is
primarily an exercise in collaboration and communication, and
publishing a Maven site is one way to make sure that your project is
communicating with your end-users.

A web site for an open source project is often the foundation for both
the end-user and developer communities alike. End-users look to a
project's web site for tutorials, user guides, API documentation, and
mailing list archives, and developers look to a project's web site for
design documents, code reports, issue tracking, and release
plans. Large open-source projects may be integrated with wikis, issue
trackers, and continuous integration systems which help to augment a
project's online documentation with material that reflects the current
status of ongoing development. If a new open source project has an
inadequate web site which fails to convey basic information to
prospective users, it often is a sign that the project in question
will fail to be adopted. In other words, for an open source project,
the site and the documentation are as important to the formation of a
community as the code itself.

Maven can be used to create a project web site to capture information
which is relevant to both the end-user and the developer audience. Out
of the box, Maven can generate reports on everything from unit test
failures to package coupling to reports on code quality. Maven
provides you with the ability to write simple web pages and render
those pages against a consistent project template. Maven can publish
site content in multiple formats including XHTML and PDF. Maven can be
used to generate API documentation and can also be used to embed
Javadoc and source code in your project's binary release archive. Once
you've used Maven to generate all of your project's end-user and
developer documentation, you can then use Maven to publish your web
site to a remote server.

[[site-generation-sect-building]]
=== Building a Project Site with Maven

To illustrate the process of building a project website, create a
sample Maven project with the archetype plugin:

----
$ mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=org.sonatype.mavenbook -DartifactId=sample-project

----

This creates the simplest possible Maven project with one Java class
in 'src/main/java' and a simple POM. You can then build a Maven site
by simply running +mvn site+. To build the site and preview the result
in a browser, you can run +mvn site:run+, this will build the site and
start an embedded instance of Jetty.

----
$ cd sample-project
$ mvn site:run
[INFO] Scanning for projects...

----

Once Jetty starts and is listening to port 8080, you can see the
project's site when you go to
http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/] in a web browser. You
can see the results in <<fig-simple-site>>.

[[fig-simple-site]]
.Simple Generated Maven Site
image::figs/web/site_index.png[]

If you click around on this simple site, you'll see that it isn't very
helpful as a real project site. There's just nothing there (and it
doesn't look very good). Since the +sample-project+ hasn't configured
any developers, mailing lists, issue tracking providers, or source
code repositories, all of these pages on the project site will have no
information. Even the index page of the site states, "There is
currently no description associated with this project". To customize
the site, you'll have to start to add content to the project and to
the project's POM.

If you are going to use the Maven Site plugin to build your project's
site, you'll want to customize it. You will want to populate some of
the important fields in the POM that tell Maven about the people
participating in the project, and you'll want to customize the
left-hand navigation menu and the links visible in the header of the
page. To customize the contents of the site and affect the contents of
the left-hand navigation menu, you will need to edit the site
descriptor.

[[site-generation-sect-custom-descript]]
=== Customizing the Site Descriptor

When you add content to the site, you are going to want to modify the
left-hand navigation menu that is generated with your site. The
following site descriptor customizes the logo in the upper left-hand
corner of the site. In addition to customizing the header of the site,
this descriptor adds a menu section to the left-hand navigation menu
under the heading "Sample Project". This menu contains a single link
to an overview page.

.An Initial Site Descriptor
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    <bannerLeft>
        <name>Sonatype</name>
        <src>images/logo.png</src>
        <href>http://www.sonatype.com</href>
    </bannerLeft>
    <body>
        <menu name="Sample Project">
            <item name="Overview" href="index.html"/>  
        </menu>
        <menu ref="reports"/>
    </body>
</project>
----

This site descriptor references one image. This 'logo.png' image
should be placed in '+++${basedir}/src/site/resources/images+++'. In
addition to the change to the site descriptor, you'll want to create a
simple 'index.apt' page in '+++${basedir}/src/site/apt+++'. Put the
following content in 'index.apt', it will be transformed to the
'index.html' and serve as the first page a user sees when they come to
your project's Maven-generated web site.

----
  Welcome to the Sample Project, we hope you enjoy your time
on this project site.  We've tried to assemble some 
great user documentation and developer information, and 
we're really excited that you've taken the time to visit
this site.

What is Sample Project

Well, it's easy enough to explain.   This sample project is 
a sample of a project with a Maven-generated site from
Maven: The Definitive	Guide.   A dedicated team of volunteers
help maintain this sample site, and so on and so forth.

----

To preview the site, run +mvn clean site+ followed by +mvn site:run+:

----
$ mvn clean site
$ mvn site:run
----

Once you do this, load the page in a browser by going to
http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]. You should see something
similar to the screenshot in <<fig-custom-simple>>.

[[fig-custom-simple]]
.Customized Sample Project Web Site
image::figs/web/site_custom-descriptor.png[]

[[site-generation-sect-custom-header]]
==== Customizing the Header Graphics

To customize the graphics which appear in the upper left-hand and
right-hand corners of the page, you can use the +bannerLeft+ and
+bannerRight+ elements in a site descriptor.

.Adding a Banner Left and Banner Right to Site Descriptor
----
<project name="Sample Project">

    <bannerLeft>
        <name>Left Banner</name>
        <src>images/banner-left.png</src>
        <href>http://www.google.com</href>
    </bannerLeft>

    <bannerRight>
        <name>Right Banner</name>
        <src>images/banner-right.png</src>
        <href>http://www.yahoo.com</href>
    </bannerRight>
    ...
</project>
----

Both the +bannerLeft+ and +bannerRight+ elements take +name+, +src+,
and +href+ child elements. In the site descriptor shown above, the
Maven Site plugin will generate a site with 'banner-left.png' in the
left-hand corner of the page and banner-right in the right-hand corner
of the page. Maven is going to look in
'+++${basedir}/src/site/resources/images+++' for these images.

[[site-generation-sect-custom-nav]]
==== Customizing the Navigation Menu

To customize the contents of the navigation menu, use the +menu+
element with +item+ child elements. The +menu+ element adds a section
to the left-hand navigation menu. Each item is rendered as a link in
that menu.

.Creating Menu Items in a Site Descriptor
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <body>

        <menu name="Sample Project">
            <item name="Introduction" href="index.html"/>
            <item name="News" href="news.html"/>
            <item name="Features" href="features.html"/>
            <item name="Installation" href="installation.html"/>
            <item name="Configuration" href="configuration.html"/>
            <item name="FAQ" href="faq.html"/>
        </menu>
        ...
    </body>
</project>
----

Menu items can also be nested. If you nest items, you will be creating
a collapsible menu in the left-hand navigation menu. The following
example adds a link "Developer Resources" which links to
'/developer/index.html'. When a user is looking at the Developer
Resources page, the menu items below the Developer Resources menu item
will be expanded.

.Adding a Link to the Site Menu
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <body>
        ...
        <menu name="Sample Project">
            ...
            <item name="Developer Resources" href="/developer/index.html" 
                  collapse="true">
                <item name="System Architecture" href="/developer/architecture.html"/>
                <item name="Embedder's Guide" href="/developer/embedding.html"/>
            </item>
        </menu>
        ...
    </body>
</project>
----

When an item has the +collapse+ attribute set to +true+, Maven will
collapse the item until a user is viewing that specific page. In the
previous example, when the user is not looking at the Developer
Resources page, Maven will not display the System Architecture and
Embedder's Guide links; instead, it will display an arrow pointing to
the Developer Resources link. When the user is viewing the Developer
Resources page it will show these links with an arrow pointing down.

[[site-generation-sect-dir-struct]]
=== Site Directory Structure

Maven places all site documents under 'src/site'. Documents of similar
format are placed in subdirectories of 'src/site'. All APT documents
should be in 'src/site/apt', all FML documents should be in
'src/site/fml', and XDoc documents should be in 'src/site/xdoc'. The
site descriptor should be in 'src/site/site.xml', and all resources
should be stored under 'src/site/resources'. When the Maven Site
plugin builds a web site, it will copy everything in the resources
directory to the root of the site. If you store an image in
'src/site/resources/images/test.png', you would refer to the image
from your site documentation using the relative path
'images/test.png'.

The following example shows the location of all files in a project
which contains APT, FML, HTML, XHTML, and some XDoc. Note that the
XHTML content is simply stored in the resources directory. The
architecture.html file will not be processed by Doxia, it will simply
be copied to the output directory. You can use this approach if you
want to include unprocessed HTML content and you don't want to take
advantage of the templating and formatting capabilities of Doxia and
the Maven Site plugin.

----
sample-project
+- src/
   +- site/
      +- apt/
      |  +- index.apt
      |  +- about.apt
      |  |
      |  +- developer/
      |  +- embedding.apt
      |
      +- fml/
      |  +- faq.fml
      |
      +- resources/
      |  +- images/
      |  |  +- banner-left.png
      |  |  +- banner-right.png
      |  |
      |  +- architecture.html
      |  +- jira-roadmap-export-2007-03-26.html
      |
      +- xdoc/
      |  +- xml-example.xml
      |
      +- site.xml

----

Note that the developer documentation is stored in
'src/site/apt/developer/embedding.apt'. This extra directory below the
'apt' directory will be reflected in the location of the resulting
HTML page on the site. When the Site plugin renders the contents of
the 'src/site/apt' directory it will produce HTML output in
directories relative to the site root. If a file is in the apt
directory it will be in the root directory of the generated web
site. If a file is in the 'apt/developer' directory it will be
generated in the 'developer/' directory of the web site.

[[site-generation-sect-proj-doc]]
=== Writing Project Documentation

Maven uses a documentation-processing engine called Doxia which reads
multiple source formats into a common document model. Doxia can then
manipulate documents and render the result into several output
formats, such as PDF or XHTML. To write document for your project, you
will need to write your content in a format which can be parsed by
Doxia. Doxia currently has support for Almost Plain Text (APT), XDoc
(a Maven 1.x documentation format), XHTML, and FML (useful for FAQ
documents) formats.

This chapter has a cursory introduction to the APT format. For a
deeper understand of the APT format, or for an in-depth introduction
to XDoc or FML, please see the following resources:

* APT Reference:
   http://maven.apache.org/doxia/format.html[http://maven.apache.org/doxia/format.html]

* XDoc Reference:

* FML Reference:

[[site-generation-apt-example]]
==== APT Example

<<ex-apt>> shows a simple APT document with an introductory paragraph
and a simple list. Note that the list is terminated by the
psuedo-element "[]".

[[site-generation-sect-deploy-site]]
=== Deploying Your Project Website

Once your project's documentation has been written and you've creates
a site to be proud of, you will want to deploy it to a server. To
deploy your site you'll use the Maven Site plugin which can take care
of deploying your project's site to a remote server using a number of
methods including FTP, SCP, and DAV. To deploy the site using DAV,
configure the site entry of the +distributionManagement+ section in
the POM, like this:

.Configuring Site Deployment
----
<project>
    ...
    <distributionManagement>
        <site>
            <id>sample-project.website</id>
            <url>dav:https://dav.sample.com/sites/sample-project</url>
        </site>
    </distributionManagement>
    ...
</project>
----

The +url+ in distribution management has a leading indicator +dav+
which tells the Maven Site plugin to deploy the site to a URL that is
able to understand WebDAV. Once you have added the
+distributionManagement+ section to our +sample-project+ POM, we can
try deploying the site:

----
$ mvn clean site-deploy
----

If you have a server configured properly that can understand WebDAV,
Maven will deploy your project's web site to the remote server. If you
are deploying this project to a site and server visible to the public,
you are going to want to configure your web server to access for
credentials. If your web server asks for a username and password (or
other credentials, you can configure this values in your
'~/.m2/settings.xml').

[[site-generation-sect-server-auth]]
==== Configuring Server Authentication

To configure a username/password combination for use during the site
deployment, we'll include the following in '$HOME/.m2/settings.xml':

.Storing Server Authentication in User-specific Settings
----
<settings>
    ...
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>sample-project.website</id>
            <username>jdcasey</username>
            <password>b@dp@ssw0rd</password>
        </server>
        ...
    </servers>
    ...
</settings>
----

The server authentication section can contain a number of
authentication elements. In the event you're using SCP for deployment,
you may wish to use public-key authentication. To do this, specify the
+publicKey+ and+ passphrase+ elements, instead of the password
element. You may still want to configure the username element,
depending on your server's configuration.

[[site-generation-sect-modes]]
==== Configuring File and Directory Modes

If you are working in a large group of developers, you'll want to make
sure that your web site's files end up with the proper user and group
permissions after they are published to the remote server. To
configure specific file and directory modes for use during the site
deployment, include the following in '$HOME/.m2/settings.xml':

.Configuring File and Directory Modes on Remote Servers
----
<settings>
    ...
    <servers>
        ...
        <server>
            <id>hello-world.website</id>
            ...
            <directoryPermissions>0775</directoryPermissions>
            <filePermissions>0664</filePermissions>
        </server>
    </servers>
    ...
</settings>
----

The above settings will make any directories readable and writable by
either the owner or members of the owner's primary group; the
anonymous users will only have access to read and list the
directory. Similarly, the owner or members of the owner's primary
group will have access to read and write any files, with the rest of
the world restricted to read-only access.

[[site-generation-sect-site-appearance]]
=== Customizing Site Appearance

The default Maven template leaves much to be desired. If you wish to
customize your project's website beyond simply adding content,
navigational elements, and custom logos. Maven offers several
mechanisms for customizing your website that offer successively deeper
access to content decoration and website structure. For small,
per-project tweaks, providing a custom 'site.css' is often
enough. However, if you want your customizations to be reusable across
multiple projects, or if your customizations involve changing the
XHTML that Maven generates, you should consider creating your own
Maven website skin.

[[site-generation-sect-site-css]]
==== Customizing the Site CSS

The easiest way to affect the look and feel of your project's web site
is through the project's 'site.css'. Just like any images or XHTML
content you provide for the website, the 'site.css' file goes in the
'src/site/resources' directory. Maven expects this file to be in the
'src/site/resources/css' subdirectory. With CSS it is possible to
change text styling properties, layout properties, and even add
background images and custom bullet graphics. For example, if we
decided that to make the menu heading stand out a little more, we
might try the following style in 'src/site/resources/css/site.css':

----
#navcolumn h5 {
font-size: smaller;
border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
background-color: #bbb;
margin-top: 7px;
margin-bottom: 2px;
padding-top: 2px;
padding-left: 2px;
color: #000;
}

----

When you regenerate the website, the menu headers should be framed by
a gray background and separated from the rest of the menu by some
extra margin space. Using this file, any structure in the
Maven-generated website can be decorated with custom CSS. When you
change 'site.css' in a specific Maven project, the changes will apply
to that specific project. If you are interested in making changes that
will apply to more than one Maven project, you can create a custom
skin for the Maven Site plugin.

TIP: There is no good reference for the structure of the default Maven
site template. If you are attempting to customize the style of your
Maven project, you should use a Firefox extension like Firebug as a
tool to explore the DOM for your project's pages.

[[site-generation-sect-custom-template]]
==== Create a Custom Site Template

If the default Maven Site structure just doesn't do it for you, you
can always customize the Maven site template. Customizing the Maven
Site template gives you complete control over the ultimate output of
the Maven plugin, and it is possible to customize your project's site
template to the point where it hardly resembles the structure of a
default Maven site template.

The Site plugin uses a rendering engine called Doxia, which in turn
uses a Velocity template to render the XHTML for each page. To change
the page structure that is rendered by default, we can configure the
site plugin in our POM to use a custom page template. The site
template is fairly complex, and you'll need to have a good starting
point for your customization. Start by copying the default Velocity
template from Doxia's Subversion repository
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/doxia/doxia-sitetools/trunk/doxia-site-renderer/src/main/resources/org/apache/maven/doxia/siterenderer/resources/default-site.vm?revision=595592[default-site.vm]
to 'src/site/site.vm'. This template is written in a templating
language called Velocity. Velocity is a simple templating language
which supports simple macro definition and allows you to access an
object's methods and properties using simple notation. A full
introduction is beyond the scope of this book, for more information
about Velocity and a full introduction please go to the Velocity
project site at
http://velocity.apache.org[http://velocity.apache.org].

The 'default-site.xml' template is fairly involved, but the change
required to customize the left-hand menu is relatively
straightforward. If you are trying to change the appearance of a
+menuItem+, locate the +menuItem+ macro. It resides in a section that
looks like this:

----
#macro ( menuItem $item )

...

#end
----

If you replace the macro definition with the macro definition listed
below, you will injects Javascript references into each menu item
which will allow the reader to expand or collapse the menu tree
without suffering through a full page reload:

----
#macro ( menuItem $item $listCount )
#set ( $collapse = "none" )
#set ( $currentItemHref = $PathTool.calculateLink( $item.href, 
$relativePath ) )
#set ( $currentItemHref = $currentItemHref.replaceAll( "\\", "/" ) )

#if ( $item && $item.items && $item.items.size() > 0 )
#if ( $item.collapse == false )
#set ( $collapse = "collapsed" )
#else
## By default collapsed
#set ( $collapse = "collapsed" )
#end

#set ( $display = false )
#displayTree( $display $item )

#if ( $alignedFileName == $currentItemHref || $display )
#set ( $collapse = "expanded" )
#end
#end
<li class="$collapse">
#if ( $item.img )
#if ( ! ( $item.img.toLowerCase().startsWith("http") || 
$item.img.toLowerCase().startsWith("https") ) )
#set ( $src = $PathTool.calculateLink( $item.img, $relativePath ) )
#set ( $src = $item.img.replaceAll( "\\", "/" ) )
<img src="$src"/>
#else
<img src="$item.img" align="absbottom" style="border-width: 0"/>
#end
#end
#if ( $alignedFileName == $currentItemHref )
<strong>$item.name</strong>
#else
#if ( $item && $item.items && $item.items.size() > 0 )
<a onclick="expand('list$listCount')" 
style="cursor:pointer">$item.name</a>
#else
<a href="$currentItemHref">$item.name</a>
#end
#end
#if ( $item && $item.items && $item.items.size() > 0 )
#if ( $collapse == "expanded" )
<ul id="list$listCount" style="display:block">
#else
<ul id="list$listCount" style="display:none">
#end
#foreach( $subitem in $item.items )
#set ( $listCounter = $listCounter + 1 )
#menuItem( $subitem $listCounter )
#end
</ul>
#end
</li>
#end
----

This change adds a new parameter to the +menuItem+ macro. For the new
functionality to work, you will need to change references to this
macro, or the resulting template may produce unwanted or internally
inconsistent XHTML. To finish changing these references, make a
similar replacement in the +mainMenu+ macro. Find this macro by
looking for something similar to the following template snippet:

----
#macro ( mainMenu $menus )
...
#end
----

Replace the mainMenu macro with the following implementation:

----
#macro ( mainMenu $menus )
#set ( $counter = 0 )
#set ( $listCounter = 0 )
#foreach( $menu in $menus )
#if ( $menu.name )
<h5 onclick="expand('menu$counter')">$menu.name</h5>
#end
<ul id="menu$counter" style="display:block">
#foreach( $item in $menu.items )
#menuItem( $item $listCounter )
#set ( $listCounter = $listCounter + 1 )
#end
</ul>
#set ( $counter = $counter + 1 )
#end
#end
----

This new +mainMenu+ macro is compatible with the new +menuItem+ macro
above, and also provides support for a Javascript-enabled top-level
menu. Clicking on a top-level menu item with children will expand the
menu and allow users to see the entire tree without waiting for a page
to load.

The change to the +menuItem+ macro introduced an +expand()+ Javascript
function. This method needs to be added to the main XHTML template at
the bottom of this template file. Find the section that looks similar
to the following:

----
<head>
    ...
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" 
          content="text/html; charset=${outputEncoding}" />
    ...
</head>
----

and replace it with this:

----
<head>
    ...
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" 
          content="text/html; charset=${outputEncoding}" />
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function expand( item ) {
        var expandIt = document.getElementById( item );
        if( expandIt.style.display == "block" ) {
        expandIt.style.display = "none";
        expandIt.parentNode.className = "collapsed";
        } else {
        expandIt.style.display = "block";
        expandIt.parentNode.className = "expanded";
        }
        }
    </script>
    #if ( $decoration.body.head )
    #foreach( $item in $decoration.body.head.getChildren() )
    #if ( $item.name == "script" )
    $item.toUnescapedString()
    #else
    $item.toString()
    #end
    #end
    #end
</head>
----

After modifying the default site template, you'll need to configure
your project's POM to reference this new site template. To customize
the site template, you'll need to use the +templateDirectory+ and
template configuration properties of the Maven Site plugin.

.Customizing the Page Template in a Project's POM
----
<project>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <templateDirectory>src/site</templateDirectory>
                    <template>site.vm</template>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ...
</project>
----

Now, you should be able to regenerate your project website. When you
do so you may notice that the resources and CSS for the maven site are
missing. When a Maven project customizes the site template, the Site
plugin expects the project to supply all of the default images and
CSS. To seed your project's resources, you may want to copy the
resources from the default Doxia site renderer project to your own
project's resources directory by executing the following commands:

----
$ svn co \
      http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/doxia-sitetools/\
      trunk/doxia-site-renderer
$ rm \
      doxia-site-renderer/src/main/resources/org/apache/maven/\
      doxia/siterenderer/resources/css/maven-theme.cs+
$ cp -rf \
      doxia-site-renderer/src/main/resources/org/apache/maven/\
      doxia/siterenderer/resources/* \
      sample-project/src/site/resources
----

Check out the +doxia-site-renderer+ project, remove the default
'maven-theme.css' file and then copy all the resources to your
project's 'src/site/resources' directory.

When you regenerate the site, you'll notice that a few menu items look
like regular unstyled text. This is caused by a quirky interaction
between the site's CSS and our new custom page template. It can be
fixed by modifying our 'site.css' to restore the proper link color for
these menus. Simply add this:

----
li.collapsed, li.expanded, a:link {
    color:#36a;
}
----

After regenerating the site, the menu's link color should be
corrected. If you applied the new site template to the same
sample-project from this chapter, you'll notice that the menu now
consists of a tree. Clicking on "Developer Resources" no longer takes
you to the "Developer Resources" page; in stead, it expands the
sub-menu. Since you've turned the Developer Resources menu-item into a
dynamically-folding sub-menu, you have lost the ability to reach the
'developer/index.apt' page. To address this change, you should add an
Overview link to the sub-menu which references the same page:

.Adding a Menu Item to a Site Descriptor
----
<project name="Hello World">
    ...
    <menu name="Main Menu">
        ...
        <item name="Developer Resources" collapse="true">
            <item name="Overview" href="/developer/index.html"/>
            <item name="System Architecture" href="/developer/architecture.html"/>
            <item name="Embedder's Guide" href="/developer/embedding.html"/>
        </item>
    </menu>
    ...
</project>

[[site-generation-sect-reusable-skin]]
==== Reusable Website Skins

If your organization is creating many Maven project sites, you will
likely want to reuse site template and CSS customizations throughout
an organization. If you want thirty projects to share the same CSS and
site template, you can use Maven's support for skinning. Maven Site
skins allow you to package up resources and templates which can be
reused by other projects in lieu of duplicating your site template for
each project which needs to be customized.

While you can define your own skin, you may want to consider using one
of Maven's alternate skins. You can choose from several skins. These
each provide their own layout for navigation, content, logos, and
templates:

*  Maven Classic Skin - +org.apache.maven.skins:maven-classic-skin:1.0+ 

*  Maven Default Skin - +org.apache.maven.skins:maven-default-skin:1.0+ 

*  Maven Stylus Skin - org.apache.maven.skins:maven-stylus-skin:1.0.1  

You can find an up-to-date and comprehensive listing in the Maven
repository:
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/skins/[http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/skins/].

Creating a custom skin is a simple matter of wrapping your customized
'maven-theme.css' in a Maven project, so that it can be referenced by
+groupId+, +artifactId+, and +version+. It can also include resources
such as images, and a replacement website template (written in
Velocity) that can generate a completely different XHTML page
structure. In most cases, custom CSS can manage the changes you
desire. To demonstrate, let's create a designer skin for the
sample-project project, starting with a custom 'maven-theme.css'.

Before we can start writing our custom CSS, we need to create a
separate Maven project to allow the +sample-project+ site descriptor
to reference it. First, use Maven's archetype plugin to create a basic
project. Issue the following command from the directory above the
+sample-project+ project's root directory:

----
$ mvn archetype:create -DartifactId=sample-site-skin 
      -DgroupId=org.sonatype.mavenbook
----

This will create a project (and a directory) called
+sample-site-skin+. Change directories to the new +sample-site-skin+
directory, remove all of the source code and tests, and create a
directory to store your skin's resources:

----
$ cd sample-site-skin
$ rm -rf src/main/java src/test
$ mkdir src/main/resources
----

[[site-generation-sect-custom-theme-css]]
==== Creating a Custom Theme CSS

Next, write a custom CSS for the custom skin. A custom CSS stylesheet
in a Maven site skin should be placed in
'src/main/resources/css/maven-theme.css'. Unlike the 'site.css' file,
which goes in the site-specific source directory for a project, the
'maven-theme.css' will be bundled in a JAR artifact in your local
Maven repository. In order for the maven-theme.css file to be included
in the skin's JAR file, it must reside in the main project-resources
directory, 'src/main/resources'.

As with the default the default site template, you will want to start
customizing your new skin's CSS from a good starting point. Copy the
CSS file used by the default Maven skin to your project's
'maven-theme.css'. To get a copy of this theme file, save the contents
of
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/skins/trunk/maven-default-skin/src/main/resources/css/maven-theme.css?view=co[maven-theme.css]
from the +maven-default-skin+ project to
'src/main/resources/css/maven-theme.css' in our new skin project.

Now that we have the base theme file in place, customize it using the
CSS from our old site.css file. Replace the +#navcolumn h5+ CSS block
with the following:

----
#navcolumn h5 {
font-size: smaller;
border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;
background-color: #bbb;
margin-top: 7px;
margin-bottom: 2px;
padding-top: 2px;
padding-left: 2px;
color: #000;
}
----

Once you've customized the 'maven-theme.css', build and install the
+sample-site-skin+ JAR artifact to your local Maven repository by
running:

----
$ mvn clean install

----

Once the installation is complete, switch back to the 'sample-project'
project directory, if you already customized the 'site.css' earlier in
this chapter, move 'site.css' to 'site.css.bak' so it no longer
affects the output of the Maven Site plugin:

----
$ mv src/site/resources/css/site.css src/site/resources/css/site.css.bak
----

To use the +sample-site-skin+ in the +sample-project+ site, you'll
need to add a reference to the +sample-site-skin+ artifact in the
+sample-project+'s site descriptor. A site references a skin in the
site descriptor using the skin element:

.Configuring a Custom Site Skin in Site Descriptor
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <skin>
        <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>
        <artifactId>sample-site-skin</artifactId>
    </skin>
    ...
</project>
----

You can think of a Maven Site skin as a site dependency. Site skins
are referenced as artifacts with a groupId and an artifactId. Using a
site skin allows you to consolidate site customizations to a single
project, and makes reusing custom CSS and site templates as easy as
reusing build logic through a custom Maven plugin.

[[site-generation-sect-tips-tricks]]
=== Tips and Tricks

This section lists some useful tips and tricks you can use when
creating a Maven site.

[[site-generation-sect-inject-xhtml]]
==== Inject XHTML into HEAD

To inject XHTML into the HEAD element, add a head element to the body
element in your project's Site descriptor. The following example adds
a feed link to every page in the +sample-project+ web site.

.Injecting HTML into the HEAD element
----
<project name="Hello World">
    ...
    <body>
        <head>
            <link href="http://sample.com/sites/sample-project/feeds/blog"
                  type="application/atom+xml" 
                  id="auto-discovery" 
                  rel="alternate" 
                  title="Sample Project Blog" />
        </head>
        ...
    </body>
</project>
----

[[site-generation-sect-add-links]]
==== Add Links under Your Site Logo

If you are working on a project which is being developed by an
organization, you may want to add links under your project's
logo. Assume that your project is a part of the Apache Software
Foundation, you might want to add a link to the Apache Software
Foundation web site right below your logo, and you might want to add a
link to a parent project as well. To add links below your site logo,
just add a links element to the body element in the Site
descriptor. Each item element in the links element will be rendered as
a link in a bar directly below your project's logo. The following
example would add a link to the Apache Software Foundation followed by
a link to the Apache Maven project.

.Adding Links Under Your Site Logo
----
<project name="Hello World">
    ...
    <body>
        ...
        <links>
            <item name="Apache" href="http://www.apache.org"/>
            <item name="Maven" href="http://maven.apache.org"/>
        </links>
        ...
    </body>
</project>
----

[[site-generation-add-breadcumbs]]
==== Add Breadcrumbs to Your Site

If your hierarchy exists within a logical hierarchy, you may want to
place a series of breadcrumbs to give the user a sense of context and
give them a way to navigate up the tree to projects which might
contain the current project as a subproject. To configure breadcrumbs,
add a +breadcrumbs+ element to the +body+ element in the site
descriptor. Each +item+ element will render a link, and the items in
the +breadcrumbs+ element will be rendered in order. The breadcrumb
items should be listed from highest level to lowest level. In the
following site descriptor, the Codehaus item would be seen to contain
the Mojo item.

.Configuring the Site's Breadcrumbs
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <body>
        ...
        <breadcrumbs>
            <item name="Codehaus" href="http://www.codehaus.org"/>
            <item name="Mojo" href="http://mojo.codehaus.org"/>
        </breadcrumbs>
        ...
    </body>
</project>
----

[[site-generation-sect-add-project-version]]
==== Add the Project Version

When you are documenting a project that has multiple versions, it is
often very helpful to list the project's version number on every
page. To display your project's version on the website, simply add the
+version+ element to your site descriptor:

.Positioning the Version Information
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <version position="left"/>
    ...
</project>
----

This will position the version (in the case of the sample-project
project, it will say "Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT") in the upper left-hand
corner of the site, right next to the default "Last Published"
date. Valid positions for the project version are:

left::

   Left side of the bar just below the site logo  

right::

   Right side of the bar just below the site logo  

navigation-top::

   Top of the menu  

navigation-bottom::

   Bottom of the menu  

none::

   Suppress the version entirely

[[site-generation-sect-mod-pubdate]]
==== Modify the Publication Date Format and Location

In some cases, you may wish to reformat or reposition the "Last
Published" date for your project website. Just like the project
version tip above, you can specify the position of the publication
date by using one of the following:

left::

   Left side of the bar just below the site logo  

right::

   Right side of the bar just below the site logo  

navigation-top::

   Top of the menu  

navigation-bottom::

   Bottom of the menu  

none::

   Suppress the publication entirely   

.Positioning the Publish Date
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <publishDate position="navigation-bottom"/>
    ...
</project>
----

By default, the publication date will be formatted using the date
format string +MM/dd/yyyy+. You can change this format by using the
standard notation found in the JavaDocs for
SimpleDateFormat (see JavaDoc for
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[SimpleDateFormat]
for more information). To reformat the date using +yyyy-MM-dd+, use
the following +publishDate+ element.

.Configuring the Publish Date Format
----
<project name="Sample Project">
    ...
    <publishDate position="navigation-bottom" format="yyyy-MM-dd"/>
    ...
</project>
----

[[site-generation-sect-doxia-macros]]
==== Using Doxia Macros

In addition to its advanced document rendering features, Doxia also
provides a macro engine that allows each input format to trigger
injection of dynamic content. An excellent example of this is the
snippet macro, which allows a document to pull a code snippet out of a
source file that's available via HTTP. Using this macro, a small
fragment of APT can be rendered into XHTML. The following APT code
calls out to the snippet macro. Please note that this code should be
on a single continuous line, the black slash character is inserted to
denote a line break so that this code will fit on the printed page.

WARNING: Doxia macros MUST NOT be indented in APT source
documents. Doing so will result in the APT parser skipping the macro
altogether.

For more information about defining snippets in your code for
reference by the snippet macro, see the Guide to the Snippet Macro on
the Maven website, at
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-snippet-macro.html[http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-snippet-macro.html].

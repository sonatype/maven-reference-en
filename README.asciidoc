== Maven: The Complete Reference

=== About the Book

A detailed reference for Apache Maven as formerly published as part of the
book Maven: The Definitive Guide. 

The book is available in HTML and PDF format at http://www.sonatype.com/resources/books/maven-the-complete-reference[http://www.sonatype.com/resources/books/maven-the-complete-reference].


=== About this Project

This is the source code and build setup for the book. The content is
written in asciidoc format.  

- To edit asciidoc, use Emacs, vi, TextMate or whatever other text editor you prefer.  
- You can even just preview the files right in github and edit them on the web interface directly.
- Another way is to use a preview tool like this https://previewhub.github.io/asciidoc/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonatype/maven-reference-en/master/book-mvnref.asciidoc[book-mvnref.asciidoc]

The main file for the book is

* book-mvnref.asciidoc

which in turn includes a whole bunch of files named 

* chapter-*.asciidoc

These are all you should have to edit in terms of text content.

==== Figures and screenshots?  

Put them into figs/orig.

The rest is taken care of by the build.

==== Anything else? 

You'll see a lot of distracting files in that directory.  For now,
you should just ignore them.  Actually, in general, you'll notice a
number of distracting files in this project.  Really, just ignore
them or contact us directly if you need something.

==== How to Build the Book

I knew you'd ask that, and here's the simple answer:

* Install asciidoc
* Install dblatex and the docbook xsl style sheets
* Install python
* run ./build.sh

Build is known to work on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. If you use something
else you might or might not end up in trouble.
